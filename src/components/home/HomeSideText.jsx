        K72 is an agency that builds brands from every angle. Today, tomorrow
        and years from now. We think the best sparks fly when comfort zones
        get left behind and friction infuses our strategies, brands and
        communications with real feeling. We're transparent, honest and say
        what we mean, and when we believe in something, we're all in.
